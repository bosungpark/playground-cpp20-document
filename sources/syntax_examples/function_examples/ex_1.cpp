// exercise 8-1. 

// Write a function, validate_input(), that accepts two integer arguments 
// that represent the upper and lower limits for an integer that is to be entered. 

// it should accept a third argument that is a string describing the input, 
// with the string being used in the prompt for input to be entered. 

// the function should prompt for input of the value 
// within the range specified by the first two arguments and include the string identifying the type of value to be entered. 

// the function should check the input and continue to prompt for input until the value entered by the user is valid. 
// use the validate_input() function in a program that obtains a user’s date of birth and outputs it in the form of this example:

// You were born on the 21st of November, 2012

// the program should be implemented so that separate functions, month(), year(), and day(), 
// manage the input of the corresponding numerical values. 
// Don’t forget leap years—february 29, 2017, is not allowed!
